India also has a huge variety ethnic clothing native to various cultures that has different fitting patterns. Online commerce sites display a variety of brand clothes all with varying sizing systems. But there is very little acknowledgment about this across the internet. So here, I have considered the most common Indian ethnic clothing, ‚ÄúKurti‚Äù to study how sizing changes across various brands in India. </p><figure id="84ff1adf-6ddc-4ae2-8320-ef92f1face56" class="image"><a href="Indian%20clothing%20sizes%20are%20inconsistent!%20May%20I%20high%2070602b9fcb2c4669b2d56047e0950516/Frame_7.3.png"><img style="width:824px" src="Indian%20clothing%20sizes%20are%20inconsistent!%20May%20I%20high%2070602b9fcb2c4669b2d56047e0950516/Frame_7.3.png"/></a></figure><p id="d0b59ab9-39c5-4341-8936-c0334f5ef299" class="">

Unfitting clothes ordered online come with many effects such as second guessing, returning instead of enjoying the product. A few effects are more personal like dysmorphia and low self esteem on our body shapes. The returned clothes straight up end in the landfill, causing unjustified waste of time, money and resources. </p><p id="3e71008d-023a-41b7-b292-3eb7e5265596" class="">From my data analysis, I understood that fitting within a particular size name also varies significantly from brand-to-brand. But, providing size charts as detailed as possible helps the user make informed choices. This explains why many e-com sites are also exploring ways to provide more detailed information to the consumers like, model specifications, profile based suggestions and AR based virtual trial rooms.</p><p id="d1b1a5ad-e87c-4662-92c3-7c389a6fb15c" class="">
